* Set a default zoom level (Scale) and center date for each timeline, if it is the first selected
* Separate 'persons' into separate data file

 - and zoom level (span in years)


 - mouse over persons for more info (and current title)
 - click persons for expanded info or wiki page



== 'overall' timeline on the left - showing the 'big picture' (big bang to present) and illustrating the current slice being viewed

== Layouts
 - layout for simple timeline
 - layout for timeline compare (AD vs BC)
 - layouts for mobile

* Redesign columns
 - left column for 'eras' (Western + others)
 - right, middle for 'empires' (can overlap)

- Dynamic columns? -> number expands; info box is on the right

more flexibility in column placement
 (arrange into 'threads')

-- Consolidate timelines & set default layout
 
(Roman, Modern, Medieval) ==> Western
(Prehistoric, Ice Age) ==> Prehistoric



== at high zoom levels, show years as discrete bands (special/adapted kind of era)

-- Fix scrolling on person panel



=== Show current timelines loaded
	- can drag from one column to another

==== Settings panel (pop up)
 - switch calendar (Gregorian, Roman, Islamic, Chinese, Mayan, Japanese)
 - filter settings for notable persons (Leaders, Artists, Historians, Royals, Britain, America, Rome, etc.);
	notability (Tier I, II, III)


== Age unknown for persons if an 'alive' period can be determined through length of rule or other dates
	if minimum age is known in a given year (e.g. was adult) then latest birth date can be deduced and show as alive from that date


=== More event types
	: Wars and conflicts (showing the time range)
	: Species (for macro scale), showing time range
	: Improved person event bubble
	: Inventions
	
	: Globally significant events(e.g. Pyramids) on main (default) timeline
		- then more detailed events on Egypt page (e.g. Great Pyramid; Step pyramid; etc.)
		- similar for Stonehenge (initial site use, later constructions)

--> add events-only categories that can overlay existing timelines

== Allow filtering the person list by cetegory

== Events in same year should be stacked so they are visible
	

=== Category colours
	- affecting era bubbles and widgets
	- colours picked to not clash with overall scheme


=== Multiples and duplicates
	- Italy timeline to auto-include Rome (but not Byzantium)
