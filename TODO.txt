* Set a default zoom level (Scale) and center date for each timeline, if it is the first selected
* Separate 'persons' into separate data file

 - and zoom level (span in years)


 - mouse over persons for more info (and current title)
 - click persons for expanded info or wiki page



== 'overall' timeline on the left - showing the 'big picture' (big bang to present) and illustrating the current slice being viewed

== Layouts
 - layout for simple timeline
 - layout for timeline compare (AD vs BC)
 - layouts for mobile

* Redesign columns
 - left column for 'eras' (Western + others)
 - right, middle for 'empires' (can overlap)

- Dynamic columns? -> number expands; info box is on the right

more flexibility in column placement
 (arrange into 'threads')

-- Consolidate timelines & set default layout
 
(Roman, Modern, Medieval) ==> Western
(Prehistoric, Ice Age) ==> Prehistoric



== at high zoom levels, show years as discrete bands (special/adapted kind of era)

-- Fix scrolling on person panel



=== Show current timelines loaded
	- can drag from one column to another

==== Settings panel (pop up)
 - switch calendar (Gregorian, Roman, Islamic, Chinese, Mayan, Japanese)
 - filter settings for notable persons (Leaders, Artists, Historians, Royals, Britain, America, Rome, etc.);
	notability (Tier I, II, III)


== Age unknown for persons if an 'alive' period can be determined through length of rule or other dates
	if minimum age is known in a given year (e.g. was adult) then latest birth date can be deduced and show as alive from that date


=== More event types
	: Wars and conflicts (showing the time range)
	: Species (for macro scale), showing time range
	: Improved person event bubble
	: Inventions
	
	: Globally significant events(e.g. Pyramids) on main (default) timeline
		- then more detailed events on Egypt page (e.g. Great Pyramid; Step pyramid; etc.)
		- similar for Stonehenge (initial site use, later constructions)

=== More categories
	-Natural disasters, and pandemics (events-only, no eras)
	-Religion and philosophy
	-Culture and arts
	-Exploration & colonization (events-only)
	-Geology / mountain orogeny
	-Famous people (events-only)
	-British Empire (events-only)
	-Sports (events-only)

	-Canada
	-Australia
	-France
	-Germany
	-China
	-Japan
	-Russia
	-Mexico
	-....

	Fictional
	-------
	- Star Trek
	- Terminator
	- Matrix
	- Asimov (Foundation, Robots)

	Biographical
	------
	- Charles Dickens
	- Tolkien
	- Darwin


--> add events-only categories that can overlay existing timelines

== Allow filtering the person list by cetegory

== Events in same year should be stacked so they are visible
	

X === Category colours
	- affecting era bubbles and widgets
	- colours picked to not clash with overall scheme


=== Multiples and duplicates
	- Italy timeline to auto-include Rome (but not Byzantium)
	- Rome timeline to auto-include Byzantium
	- check if a timeline is already loaded in column & do not duplicate


X BUG when same category is loaded on both Timelines, drag and drop doesn't move the right category widget

- Change select to double click to avoid accidental selecting

X == Custom selector for picking a timeline (see tutorial on W3 CSS dropdowns)

=== Half-column eras
	- To avoid overlaps allow json data to specify half-column (0 or 1) or onethird-column (0, 1, 2) for eras


== Cutoff line for recorded history
	- show notable persons in ~5000BC to present day
	- show archaeological sites
	- show living species in earth-scale
	- show cosmic bodies prior to that

== handle overlapping events (same year) with a little tab to cycle between them, bringing the next one to the front
 - show the other ones underneath as 'pages'

== rename 'timeline' files to 'categories'; 'collections' can contain multiple categories
== US history: category{ Pre-Columbian North America; Post-Columbian USA}
== Canada history: category{ Pre-Columbian North America; Post-Columbian Canada}
== Mexico, etc.
== Americas: category{ Pre-Columbian North America; Pre-Columbian South America; Pre-Columbian Caribbean; Post-Columbian Americas}

== Compare / lock real & fictional timelines (history vs LOTR)


=== TimelineDate reorg
	- new TimelineDate class, more all date related funtions
	- use TimelineDate objects as data in EventBubbles, Timeline, PersonData, etc
	- define standard operations between dates (compare two dates returns the number of years between them - can be negative): date1.Difference(date2) or TimelineDate.Difference(d1,d2)
	- incorporate floating point years (currentYear etc) into TimelineDate format
	- allow display in other formats: Roman, Chinese, Japanese, French Republican, Tolkien First/second/third age, Shire Reckoning etc.


	-- cleanup
	- changed dateIntIfDefined to TimelineDate constructor
	- bubbleDate and endDate in TimelineEvent should be TimelineDate objects

=== Add faint individual year stripes at highest magnification (scale = 10-20)


BUG====


==DONE=========
 X BUG selecting an event can make it stuck to zooming to that event, so scrolling doesn't work.
	- now hopefully fixed

 X BUG when loading US or Britain timelines events are not correctly placed - to do with Date reorganization?
	- think this was fixed a while ago now

X Show current year prominently and allow to enter a specific year
 X == Person browsing mode: list of persons alive in current year (dynamically updating) + current ages and title

-- create a 'Default' load
* persons
* Western history (Modern)

== Allow same person in multiple timelines:
	X- reference 'Person Database' instead of storing info in Timeline file
	X- use a recognizable but unique ID e.g. 'CharlesII_England', 'ToussaintLouverture', 'SamuelDeChamplain'
	X- throw error if any ID is not unique
	X- make sure duplicate references don't show up in 'Persons Alive' list
	X- trial with 'hybrid' approach: use database + references for Most Notable people; existing system for others
